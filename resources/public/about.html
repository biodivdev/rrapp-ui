        <h3>About this tool</h3>
        <p>This is a
        set of <em>open-source</em> tools
        to <em>daily</em>
        collect and serve consolidated <em>taxonomic</em> and <em>occurrence</em> data
        from various <em>open data</em> sources
        , perform <em>geospatial</em> analysis
        that enable rapid <em>risk assessment</em>
        of country-level biodiversity
        , and allow simple and directed <em>visualization</em>
        of the data and results.

        <h3>What made this possible</h3>
        <p>All this work is possible due to a series of developments in contribution, publishing and technologies related to biodiversity.</p>
        <p>Namely, not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>DarwinCore standart by TDWG, that set common terms to work upon</li>
          <li>DarwinCore-Archive design by GBIF, that allowed the exchange in efficient format of information</li>
          <li>Integrated Publishing Toolkit from GBIF, that made simple and easy access to datasets</li>
          <li>GBIF push and committiment to help publishers, which allows easy dicovery of source of data</li>
          <li>IUCN Red Listing Guidelines, that provide a base set of rules for extinction risk assessment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How does this work</h3>
        <p>Specifically, the daily workflow goes as follows, mostly in parallel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collect country taxonomic information from choosen checklists published in IPT</li>
          <li>[TODO] Download and load into local IPT country occurrences from GBIF by families</li>
          <li>Collect from local and choosen IPTs occurrence datasets</li>
          <li>For each taxon:
            <ul>
              <li>Consolidate occurrences from accepted name and synonyms</li>
              <li>Classify occurrences in groups
                <ul>
                  <li>All</li>
                  <li>Historic</li>
                  <li>Recent</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>[TODO] Rate the quality of occurrences</li>
              <li>For each group of occurrences perform the following analysis
                <ul>
                  <li>Extent of occurrence (EOO)</li>
                  <li>Area of occupancy with regular grid of 2km side (AOO-2km)</li>
                  <li>Area of occupancy withh grid of variadic size (AOO-variadic)</li>
                  <li>Subpopulations/Locations/Cluster of occurrences based on circular buffer of median distance</li>
                  <li>Rapid Risk Assessment based on EOO, AOO and decline only</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Display the results and statistics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Extent of occurrences (EOO)</h4>
        <p>Utilizes a convex-hull method to calculate the total extent of occurrence for the specie.</p>
        <h4>Area of Occupancy (AOO)</h4>
        <p>Using a world grid of 2km of side and of 10% of the maximum distance between occurrences, and matching those which have occurrences on it, 
           distincts them to calculate the area of occupancy of the specie.</p>
        <h4>Population clusters</h4>
        <p>Based on 10% of the maximum distance between the species occurrences (to be changed to a minimum-spaning-tree following Rapoport's approach), draws a buffer of this radius around them
           and groups those that intersects.</p>
        <h4>Risk Assessment Analysis</h4>
        <p>Using IUCN category and criteria extinction risk assessment, but based only on geographical distribution and futher simplified.</p>

        <p>Decline and number of subpopulation might be taken into account as official guidelines suggest, if available.</p>
        <p> Due to lack of a method for some extra information (specially locations and threats), the categories had to be simplified.
            The methodology can be improved if we have easy access to such data. </p>
